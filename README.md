  # Employee Tracker (CMS App)
  ## Project Description
  This application is a no-frills command-line application for managing a company's employee database. I built this simple demo with Node.js, Inquirer.js, and MySQL for the RDBMS. After the Node.js application connects to a SQL instance, the user is able to perform the typical CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). A user can view departments, roles, or employees, or add a role or employee. A user can also make updates to existing records. A switch statement handles the possible scenarios the user may select.

  ## Installation
  After cloning or downloading a local copy of the repository, from a terminal install the required dependencies that are listed in the package.json file:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  Once the node_modules folder is created and all dependencies are downloaded, type the following in your terminal:
  
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  The *start* command effectively stands in for running "node index.js" as shown in the "scripts" property in the package.json file you download.
    
  ## Usage
  Once the app is run, follow the command-line prompts.<br>
